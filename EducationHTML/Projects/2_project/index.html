        A Broken Silence return with their highly anticipated new album Soul. It is said to be more personal than the previous records, but they are still offering some elements about political issues. Bartulovich has said “This album is definitely back to what we are all about. Hip hop/rock with a modern take on the production and sound. The last album we experimented with a lot of electronic production which was fun. However, this time we wanted to incorporate what we had learnt from the last LP and fuse it with what we really loved about the original records as well”.

        After the short intro track “37”, the album bursts into life with “Wake Up”. The thunderous drums and monstrous riffs set up a mood that means business. Torcha then comes in with “Seems like the pressure is building / No time to spend with my children / Seems like I’m working for nothing / Feels like I’ve wasted a million”. The band’s trademark sound is complete when Bartulovich arrives for the chorus. From here until the end, he adds his blend of melodic vocals and screaming dynamics to the mix. 
        Throughout the release, you have to admire how this duo delivers each song with such confidence. Over time, they have learnt what works and what does not. They now know how to blend their rock/hip-hop soundtrack with their impactful stories/messages to maximum effect.
